SciNet-ZK is a peer-to-peer network designed to facilitate **censorship-resistant scientific collaboration** using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), cryptographic data signing, and decentralized content filtering. It enables users to share and access data without relying on centralized authorities, while ensuring ethical compliance through community-governed blacklists.

## **Features**  
🔒 **Privacy-First Authentication**: Join the network using ZKPs without revealing identities.  
📡 **Decentralized Routing**: Connect via peer IDs (not IPs) using libp2p and Kademlia DHT.  
📝 **Signed Data Integrity**: All content is cryptographically signed with Ed25519.  
🚫 **Ethical Filtering**: Community-voted Merkle-tree blacklists to block prohibited content.  
🔍 **Named Data Access**: Request data by name (e.g., `/genomics/dataset-2023`).  

**It is currently under development. However, users who wish can download and write their own node servers and protocols for installation.**
